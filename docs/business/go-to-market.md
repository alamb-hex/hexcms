### Phase 2: Open Source Launch (Month 2-3)

**Goals:**
- 100 GitHub stars in first week
- 1000+ visitors to landing page
- 20+ developers trying it
- Initial community formation

**Launch Platforms:**

#### 1. Hacker News
**When:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-10 AM PT

**Title:** "Show HN: Open-source CMS with Git workflow and database speed"

**Post content:**
```
Hi HN! I built [Product Name] to solve a problem I kept hitting: 
blog builds getting slower as content grows.

Traditional SSGs parse markdown files at build time. With 100+ posts, 
this adds minutes to every build. Headless CMSs solve this but cost 
$100-500/mo and lock you into proprietary formats.

[Product Name] takes a hybrid approach: 
- Content in Git (markdown files)
- Parsed once and stored in Postgres
- Next.js queries the database
- Builds stay under 2 minutes regardless of post count

It's open source (MIT), built with Next.js, and deploys to Vercel.

Tech stack: Next.js, Postgres, GitHub webhooks

Demo: [link]
GitHub: [link]
Docs: [link]

Would love feedback from the community!
```

**Expected Results:**
- 200-500 upvotes (if well-received)

- 2000-5000 visitors

- Maybe some early contributors

```
1/ Launching [Product Name] - an open-source CMS that stays fast as your 
blog grows üöÄ

I got frustrated with 10-minute blog builds, so I built something better.

Here's how it works üßµ

2/ The Problem:
Traditional SSGs parse markdown files at build time.
100 posts = fine
500 posts = slow
1000+ posts = painfully slow

You waste CI/CD minutes and developer time on every content change.

3/ Existing Solutions:
‚ùå Headless CMSs: $100-500/mo + vendor lock-in
‚ùå Keep using SSG: Slow builds forever
‚ùå Pure database: Lose Git workflow

None felt right. So I built something new.

4/ The Architecture:
‚úÖ Content in Git (markdown)
‚úÖ Webhook triggers parse
‚úÖ Store in Postgres
‚úÖ Next.js queries DB
‚úÖ Builds stay <2 min

Git workflow + Database speed

5/ [Screenshot of architecture diagram]

6/ Tech Stack:
- Next.js 14
- Vercel Postgres
- GitHub webhooks
- Markdown processing
- ISR for caching

All the modern tools you already use.

7/ [Demo GIF showing sync in action]

8/ It's 100% open source (MIT license)
‚≠êÔ∏è Star it: [GitHub link]
üìñ Docs: [link]
üöÄ Deploy: [link]

Built this because I needed it. Sharing because maybe you do too.

9/ What's next?
- Improving docs
- Adding features
- Building community
- Maybe a hosted version?

Would love your feedback! üôè

10/ RT to share with developers who might need this ‚Üª
